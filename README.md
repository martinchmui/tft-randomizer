# TFT Randomizer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

This application is a placeholder for users that want to choose their Tacticians, Arenas, and Booms randomly as there is currently no such feature. It takes JSON data and assets paths from https://www.communitydragon.org/ to populate the application's elements.

This application utilizes React-Bootstrap and Material-UI for most of components, and uses Redux to manage state and data. 

This project main goal and challenge was to learn how to effectively manipulate JSON data to create an app that could be interacted with. Future improvements to this application would be turning it into a standalone app that could directly interact with the Riot Client.
